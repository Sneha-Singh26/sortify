📚 Algorithms Implemented

Algorithm	Time Complexity (Best)	Time Complexity (Average)	Time Complexity (Worst)	    Space Complexity
Bubble Sort	        O(n)	                    O(n²)	                    O(n²)	                O(1)
Insertion Sort	    O(n)	                    O(n²)	                    O(n²)	                O(1)
Quick Sort	        O(n log n)	                O(n log n)	                O(n²)	                O(log n)
Merge Sort	        O(n log n)	                O(n log n)	                O(n log n)	            O(n)
Heap Sort	        O(n log n)	                O(n log n)	                O(n log n)	            O(1)
Selection Sort	    O(n²)	                    O(n²)	                    O(n²)	                O(1)
🎯 Core Functionalities
Random Array Generation: Click to generate a new array with random values.

Input Your Own Array: Enter your own array values to visualize custom sorting.

Bars Animation: Bars height represents array elements' values.

Pause and Resume: You can pause ongoing sorting and resume from where you left off.

Speed Control: Adjust the speed of the visualization as per your learning pace.

Complexity Display: Time and space complexities for each algorithm are displayed clearly.
